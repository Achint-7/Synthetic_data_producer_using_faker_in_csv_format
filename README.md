# Synthetic Data Producer using Faker in CSV Format

## Overview

This project focuses on generating synthetic data using the Faker library in Python and exporting it to a CSV format. Synthetic data is valuable for various purposes, including testing, development, and machine learning experimentation, without exposing real-world sensitive information. The Faker library provides a convenient way to create realistic-looking fake data across multiple domains.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **synthetic_data_producer.py**: This Python script is the main driver for generating synthetic data. It utilizes the Faker library to create fake data for various attributes.

2. **output_data.csv**: The generated synthetic data is exported to this CSV file. Users can customize the filename and format as needed.

## Usage

To generate synthetic data and export it to a CSV file.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script and the generated data according to your requirements:

- **Attributes**: Modify the attributes and their types to match the characteristics of your real-world data.

- **Data Quantity**: Adjust the number of records to generate by changing the `num_records` variable in the script.

- **CSV Formatting**: Customize the CSV output format, including the delimiter and filename.

## Dependencies

- **Faker**: The script relies on the Faker library to create realistic-looking fake data. Ensure it is installed before running the script.
